How we look at making money, friendships, love, etc forms the construct of the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and the way we interact with others. But, these are just beliefs, they aren't reality. Losing a belief can happen in a flicker of an eye, and your entire life starts to dissassemble.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm beginning to see why the life of entrepeneurship leads people into mental breakdowns!

I think the reason someone chooses to live is largely arbitrary, but that's what I have chosen. I have a choice not to do any of these things, but I can't imagine living without doing this. Though this doesn't address the second question&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Why would I want to do all of this at the same time?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are twenty four hours in a day. I know what my capabilities are. Why not stagger these things out over 10 years? In 10 years I'll be 29 years old. If I were to have a million dollars in the bank, have a strong family, speak 4 languages...and scuba dive, I would be fine. if I were to stagger these goals, and it doesn't have to be 10 years, I have a real shot at achieving them.</p>\r\n<p>Though, that isn't what I am doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second question is what I have been struggling with. I feel like many people don't answer the second question. I see intelligent driven people attacking at all fronts, diluting their ability to win.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For me, it was born out of a fear. A sense of urgency. I felt that if I weren't to accomplish this now, I would never be able to do it. I would be a failure to my parents, my friends, and myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's a lack of trust in yourself. If you were to do only one thing, your confidence hinges on it. Your dreams begin to clash with the world. You start to see where the edges of your capability lie.</p>\r\n<p>That's what I'm beginning to see. There is no forskaing one thing to do another. There is no urgency. There is only action. Step by step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p>Life comes with a series of complex, never ending questions. Sometimes, people are able to keep their sanity and function with the words of Seneca, Boethius, Jesus Christ, Muhammed and other systems of thoughts (Recently, celebrities have replaced some of these icons). These words are more valuable to humans than any sort of money or material object, for it helps us live our lives without too many questions. However, their massive appeal and usability lead to their downfall, because it's impossible to share the same reference point of the author, and hence many ideas don't apply to you, and you don't know which ones.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, look at the problem with homosexuality in the bible. Be good, and don't be gay. For a large majority of people, they'll be good, and they won't be gay. They weren't gay in the first place, so it's no problem. But, what of the other 1%? This mass adoption of values causes so much anxiety, stress, and destroyed relationships.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Life is like playing professional basketball. You can read about all the players, and you can know every team, and you can think you'll know who's going to win and why, but you won't be playing basketball. These values have a lot of merit, but by simply learning the values, we never learny&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>they were set in the first place. We can't replicate being Seneca, and hence we can't know why he said what he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My father told me this many times, but I never truly understood. Take the words of the philosopher, but your only true teacher is experience. It is what tells you right and wrong. Form your own opinions, and test them in the real world. At least that's the only way, for me at least, to stay true to myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p>This last month, a multitude of lessons were learned from the school of hard knocks. Working hard, making and breaking relationships, and seeing where my limits are currently.</p>\r\n<p>This all lead to a swing in net worth, and a swing in my outlook of the world. I'll try to share what I've learned, though everything's too close to home currently for me to objectively break things down.</p>\r\n<p>The most important lesson I've gotten is based on how I looked at the world. I had a very Japanese classical-eraish look at the way people and business worked. I though that the way my family treated me would permeate through my business associates and friends. I wanted to look out for other people's interest, and trust that they would look out for myne. This would lead to a much cleaner, happier exchange. No haggling necessessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The common side effect to thinking like this is that you become very intimate with people very quickly. If that's you, please read on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You meet someone to do business, or make a new friend, or a new relationship, and you're ready to do many things. You're ready to make commitments, or to sacrifice your health, things important to you, to take care of their interests. This way of treating people isn't necessarily wrong. Again, I do this with my fmaily, and I am absolutely greatful for the kind of relationship I share with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The problem with permeating this type of thining throughout is that these privelages have to be earned. A new friend, a new relationship can't possibly earn intimacy to that effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>99% of people don't see the type of good will that you're creating. You're only setting yourself up to be burned. When you see that they don't reciprocate, you swing 100% the other way. You start to feel bretrayed by the other person.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That's the second side effect. If your appraisal of a person shifts wildly, please read on.</p>\r\n<p>This is a very fucking childish way of doing business, or living life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, people need to earn that type of good will. It takes going to war together, for years on end, to really develop a relationship like that. When you meet someone and try to manufucture that experience, it's fake. It leads you to appraise people badly, and to generally do bad work and leave unfinished projects.</p>\r\n<p>My lesson is to keep people around the middle. No more wild shifts. Be professional, make backup plans, and make sure you think to yourself, how can this person fuck me in this situation. Than, try to make it so they don't have the option to fuck you.</p>\r\n<p>This doesn't mean to be hostile and bitter. That's the same as being immediately loving, it's fake. Simply put a question mark on their character, until you see it in real life. let them prove themeselves, and let yourself be proven to them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>\r\n<p>If you believe in that quote, the answer isn't to scale back on what you believe will create change. The answer is to build a better life for yourself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Do it little by little.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm going to start by fixing my sleeping schedule.</p>\r\n<p>Then, no more sugar.</p>\r\n<p>After that, maybe no hackernews</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p>Van Gogh, Shakespeare, Winston Churchill, Charles Dickens. All of these people have used their creativity to reimagine something in a new light, to instigate change and create master works. All of these people, also experienced varying degrees of depression.</p>\r\n<p>Abraham Lincoln, Isaac Newton, and the list continues. It's devastatingly too common that so many thought leaders of our generation experience depression. In effect Psychological studies indigate that depression and creativity are linked. However, we've seen over and over again how devastating it can be. When people spiral for too long, they fall to such lows thay they break down or commit suicide. We've lost a lot of great minds, and excellent ideas because of the way we handle depression, and I'm writing this post to suggest an alternative, a way to be creative without letting yourself break down.</p>\r\n<p>First, let's set scopes on Depression. I identify it as a sense of hopelessness and existential dread, that is prolonged for an <em>unnatural</em> period of time. The unnatural period of time is the literal killer. It's the spiraling into more and more severe dread, until it gets impossible to get out. If it wasn't for the spiraling effect, depression would be a completely healthy experience everyone would grow from. One facet of it, \"Rumination\" is particularily helpful for creativity. Rumination is defined as the \"compulsively focused attention on the symptoms of one's distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions.\" For example, when you ask a girl out and say something stupid, you \"ruminate\" for the next hour about how stupid what you said was. This introspection to identify mistakes, truly understand yourself and ponder on life can be the instigator to some great ideas.</p>\r\n<p>But, what kills is the spiraling effect. A sense of hopelessness piled up ontop of more hopelessness. An insight I've had on this is that it usually happens when there are <em>multiple</em> things wrong. Instead of just ruminating over one thing, people are lonely, they don't eat healthy, exercise, their place is dirty. In short <em>their life is more supporting of depression</em>.</p>\r\n<p>This was the case with me. I had a lot of things going right, but I had a horrible diet, I didn't work out enough, I didn't meet new people, so when a small roadblock showed up, it was hard to bounce back. Each depression lead to some creative insights for my business and life, but I could see where the trend was headed.</p>\r\n<p>Almost all creativity in life is basically negated if you can't get out of depression. It only has to happen once, than it's kind of over. But, I don't want to feel normal all the time. I want to be happy, and I want to be sad. I <em>want</em> to reflect and be creative.</p>\r\n<p>That's when it hit me. It was a pretty simple thought, but it was big for me. I started to change the environment around me. I wanted to allow myself to ruminate and feel depressed, but I wanted <em>everything</em> around me to dispell the other factor of depression.</p>\r\n<p>I started regulating my sleep, making sure there was healthy food all aorund me, making sure I had a social circle that I could check in with. I regularily talked with my family, and built in periods for relaxation and seeing nature in my schedule.</p>\r\n<p>I'm still on this path, but my goal is to create an environemnt around me that is possible by default. This will allow me experience the swings and be creative, while at the same time allow for me to jump back.</p>\r\n<p>If you're an entrepneur or an artist, I highly suggest asking you this question : What are the default standards in my life right now?</p>\r\n<p>How can you change those standards for the better, so that when you're in down swing it can help life you up?</p>",

Graham points out an obvious -- on a smaller time scale, there is no way doing anything is better than having fun at a beach. His definition of the upper bound is important, but I think his definition of the lower bound is most helpful --&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote><strong>Bounds</strong></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><em style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">How much</em><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">&nbsp;are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige&mdash;or sheer inertia.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most&nbsp;</span><em style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">this second</em><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked&nbsp;</span><em style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">that</em><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">&nbsp;much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken. Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. Then you want to do something else&mdash;even something mindless. But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">I put the lower bound there for practical reasons. If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems with procrastination. You'll have to force yourself to work, and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire. You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool. This doesn't mean you have to make something. If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least, wow, that's pretty cool. What there has to be is a test.</span><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><br style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\" /><span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; font-family: verdana;\">So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is reading books. Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.</span></blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>----</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: verdana; font-size: 13px;\">As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure.

No extra words, no extra actions.</p>\r\n<p>- Again, you NEED&nbsp;to have a narrative. If you did something, only say it if it helps build your narrative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Follow up&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Don't disqualify yourself. That's the job of the decision maker</p>\r\n<h2>Success perecentage has a half life on every day you don't reply</h2>\r\n<p>Say you get an email from someone you consider important. You think you can come up with an okay response, but it'll take you a day to come up with a great one. DONT wait the day! Every day you wait, imagine that your chance of getting the deal is now 50% worse. There's no way a slightly better email will make up for 50%. Even if it did, there's a much higher chance that you'll stall on the second day too, so remember that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This makes you be a responsive, on the ball type of person, which is what top performers are.</p>",

When that converation is an uncomfortable one, we predicatbly fail at it every single time.</p>\r\n<p>I.e when you meet someone, how do you start a conversation? Most people just end up talking about what they do, and it's not the best way to build rapport. We think we'll be creative in the moment, but we just end up saying the same thing.</p>\r\n<p>So, let's keep a swipe file. How about ' Hey, how did you and X meet?

This will outline the steps I'm taking, as I'm taking it.</p>\r\n<p>===</p>\r\n<p><strong>1) Google search Angular learning resources. Found a great intro video to get started --</strong></p>\r\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) While watching video, also discovered a quick codeschool course on it</strong></p>\r\n<p>http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/level/1/section/1/video/1</p>\r\n<p>I'll probably do this right after.

I really enjoyed this tutorial. Excellent way to cover ground. When taking it, I suggest you make your own local version of the app that you'll be creating on it. It'll help you internalize much better.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3) Time to look for tutorials on integrating Angular with a backend</strong></p>\r\n<p>I've got an understanding of Angular's core features, but one open question is how Angular handles data via a RESTful API. I'll be searching for tutorials on making it. Another question I have is about how to best structure an app using angular, and when to use custom directives, etc. I think to get a better sense of this, making an actual Rails App would teach a bunch.</p>\r\n<p>Right now, I'm thinking of making an app to save all of your favorite ideas, but before getting into it, I have 2 other considerations to think about. There's a coding challenge I'll be at in a few days, and I'd like to set up a dev environment for it. Once done with that, I also want to knowt the basics of react.js.

It helped cement some thoughts, and exposed what I didn't know. Very useful.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5) Discovered Great Rails and Angular Tutorial</strong></p>\r\n<p>Was scowering around for a tutorial that would help cement routing and services for Angular.

To start, I wanted to get a better sense for what the future held, so I drew a timeline. On that timeline, I filled in my 'must do's', the things I was certain would need to be on the calendar. On the side, I put all potential goals.</p>\r\n<p>This produced some surprising results for me. For my 'must to do's', I had only about 20 days filled. And for my potentials, everything seemed to be up in the air, dependent on each other. The possible combinations were too varied to think about.</p>\r\n<p>For most of my life, I had much more must do's, which allowed me to more clearily make choices.</p>\r\n<p>The skills needed to make choices in that scenario aren't so useful in this one.</p>\r\n<p>So, what does work? The first thing that comes to mind is to ignore all choices that depend on other choices -- they are too up in the air, and the number of possible combinations will make your brain explode.</p>\r\n<p>Only focus on the decisions you can immedietly act on.</p>\r\n<p>However, this can introduce a secondary problem, where by focusing too short-term, you end up missing out on longer-term investments.</p>\r\n<p>A perfect example of this, for me, was language learning.

I was more focused on business and immediete goals, and thought I wouldn't have enough time to become fluent. One year passed, I started learning Mandarin, and boy do I wish I learned for that year!</p>\r\n<p>so the soluton looks like, focus on more immediete decisions, but assume that you will be in your current state for longer.

You might have to learn a lot of new things, or have to face the dreaded 'am I good enough?' question.</p>\r\n<p>When you're doing high-upside, application oriented events, you also get the same feeling.

The excellent ones are the ones that are least likely to be particularily impressed by you.</p>\r\n<p>This gets us to sell too quickly. In order to avoid the discomfort, you might be tempted to take the very first offer, or to choose an easier challenge that doesn't quite make you work as hard.</p>\r\n<p>And the thing about the level of discomfort you can handle is that the choice becomes an unconcious one. It's not that we choose to settle early, or take on less challenging pursuits, but they become a default, rationalized behavior.</p>\r\n<p>The way to get yourself out of it is by watching other people.
